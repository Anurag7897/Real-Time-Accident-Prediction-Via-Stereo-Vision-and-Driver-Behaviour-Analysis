    "Here, estimated the depth of objects in a scene using stereo images. The technique uses the disparity between two images (left and right) taken from slightly different viewpoints. By applying stereo matching and triangulation principles, we compute the distance of objects from the camera.\n",

    "AIM:\n",
    "- To implement a stereo vision-based depth calculation algorithm.\n",
    "- To visualize and verify the depth map generated from left and right stereo images.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Dataset**: Stereo image pairs stored locally (e.g., `left image` and `right image`).\n",
    "- **Input Type**: Rectified left and right images to grayscale images.\n",
    "- **Compute Disparity**: Used OpenCV's StereoBM algorithm to compute disparity map. The StereoBM algorithm computes disparity between the two images. `numDisparities` and `blockSize` are parameters that control the window size and range of disparity search.\n",
    "- **Depth Calculation**: Applied the formula:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   (focal_length_px * baseline_m) / avg_disp\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "- **Display Results**: Visualized the disparity and depth maps using `matplotlib`."
